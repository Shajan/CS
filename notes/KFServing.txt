Setup on GCP:
1. Add a GKE cluster
   Create a pool
   Use a namespace

Setup Kubeflow:
  https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/tree/master/kfdef
    kubeflow uses to define and build (describes your install)

Configuration:
  kind: Selects the service, example "InferenceService"
  metadata/name: User defined name for that model
  spec/default/<tensorflow/pytorch/sklearn>/
    storageUri: gs://<bucket>/path
    serviceAccount: .. (kubernetes identity, with access to gcs)
    minReplicas, maxReplicas
    resources/requests/
      cpu,gpu,memory
  spec/canaryTrafficPercent : 25
  spec/canary/<tensorflow/..>/..


To add explainer
  spec/default/predictor/<tensorflow/pytorch/sklearn>/
  spec/default/explainer/alibi
    type: AnchorTabular, AnchorText,..

Notes

Canary:
* Split traffic between production and canary.
* Ability to have 0% traffic to canary, but still have an endpoint to test.

Layers:

Tensorflow/PyTorch/XGBoost/TensorRT/ONNX
Kubeflow/KFServing
KNative: Platform to build, deploy, and manage serverless workloads
  Build src code into continers
  Rollout, Autoscaling, Plug logging/monitoring
    Request based Autoscaler
  Events declarative actions/bindings between events 
Istio: Service Mesh
  Proxy controlly all traffic in and out of the pod
  Service Discovery, Load Balancing, Failure Recovery, Metrics, Monitoring, Logging
  A/B testing, Canary, Rate Limiting, Access Control, S2S Auth
Kubernetes
Compute (CPU/GPU/TPU)

MicroServices:

Predictor
  Does prediction

Explainer
  Send multiple requrest to a predictor, preturbe the input serveral times to see what parts of the input was most important. Out of the box Alibi explainer configurable in yaml
  Example given a picture, model predicts a cat. Change the picture many times to understand what part of the picture results in the model predicting a cat.
  Alibi Explainer

Transformer
  Request can be transformed expanded

Logging
  Request (optionally response as well)
  URL to send payload as CLoudEvents
  Alibi Detect : Outlier Detection, Adversarial Detection, Concept Drift
    Alert
