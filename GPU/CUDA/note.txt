Run this on a google collab terminal, make sure a GPU based runtime is used.

Concepts
nvcc : NVIDIA Cuda Compiler
Kernel : A piece of code that executes on a GPU
Warp Size : The smallest unit of threads that are scheduled together on an NVIDIA GPU (usually 32)
Block Size : Howmany threads to schedule in parallel, a multiple of Warp Size, tune for different applications.
  Consider memory bandwidth so that GPUs are not waiting, as well as max for each GPU type.
