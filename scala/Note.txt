Case Class
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2312881/what-is-the-difference-between-scalas-case-class-and-class
	Case classes can be seen as plain and immutable data-holding objects that should exclusively depend on their constructor arguments.

Apply Method
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9737352/what-is-the-apply-function-in-scala
	Syntatic shortcut, no need to type in 'apply'
		Example List(1,2,3) // Instead of List.apply(1,2,3)
	Calling 'apply' on a function pionter object just calls that function.
	Defining an 'apply' method to a type allows an instance of that type to act like a function pointer, and be called.
