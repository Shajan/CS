Why state exists (and props aren’t enough)

Props come from the parent
Props are read-only
Props describe inputs

But apps need change over time:
counters increment
forms update
toggles flip
data loads asynchronously

If everything were props, nothing could change internally.
So React introduces state.

State is data owned by a component that can change over time and cause re-rendering.
Local to a component
Mutable via React only
Triggers re-render when updated

A React component is just a function.
State is how React remembers values between function calls.

A component re-renders when:
Its state changes
Its props change
Its parent re-renders

Re-render:
React calls your component function again
Produces new React elements
React diffs old vs new
Updates DOM only if needed

NOTE:
SetState calls are scheduled, not immediate
