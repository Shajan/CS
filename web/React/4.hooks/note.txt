Hooks let React “plug into” a function call.
Hooks let React remember things across renders by relying on call order, not variable identity.

A component is just a function
React re-runs it on every render
How does React remember state between calls?
Answer: Hooks let React associate data with a function call position.

## useState
A means for scheduling update to state and trigger re-rendering if required

## useEffect
A way to have side effects (components are purely functional)
Render describes what the UI should look like
Effects describe what should happen because of it
Effects run:
after render
when dependencies change
before cleanup on next run/unmount
