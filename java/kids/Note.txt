* Conditional: Control flow step thru code; Inspect variables
1) Find larger of two numbers int max(int a, int b)
2) Find smaller of two numbers int min(int a, int b)
3) Find larger of three numbers int max(int a, int b, int c)

* Functions: Reuse & Composition
1) Find smallest of three numbers - take advantage of min(a,b) from above

* Loops: while, for, variables
1) print numbers 0 to 5
2) print numbers 0 to end
3) print numbers start to end
4) print even numbers, odd numbers less than 20

* Arrays: Scale number of items; for
1) Find largest of many numbers
2) Use while loop to find largest number
3) Use for loop to find largest number

* Primitive types: Strings, integers, boolean
