* Conditional: Control flow step thru code; Inspect variables
1) Find larger of two numbers int max(int a, int b)
2) Find smaller of two numbers int min(int a, int b)
3) Find larger of three numbers int max(int a, int b, int c)

* Functions: Reuse & Composition
1) Find smallest of three numbers - take advantage of min(a,b) from above

* Arrays: Scale number of items; Loops; Variable
1) Find largest of many numbers
2) Use while loop to find largest number
3) Use for loop to find largest number

* Primitive types: Strings, integers, boolean
