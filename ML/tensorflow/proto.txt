Notes
1. Protobuf has no int16 type, Tensor can respresent such types
2. Tensor* is mostly an in-memory c++ friendly and interacts with the model
2. Example deals with features

TensorProto
  DataType, TensorShapeProto, 
  tensor_content (bytes) or repeated <protobuf_type>_val (int16 --> int32 padded)
  
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/framework/types.proto
DataType : enum { DT_* : FLOAT, DOUBLE, [U|Q]INT[8|16|32|64],... } Q -> Quantized

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.proto
TensorShapeProto
  repeated Dim
Dim : size (-1: for unknown), name

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/example/example.proto
Example: Features
SequenceExample: Features (common), FeatureLists (sequence by time)

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/example/feature.proto
Features : map<string, Feature>
Feature: XXXList (only one type)
[Byte|Float|Int64]List : repeated [bytes|float|int64]
FeatureList : repeaed Feature
FeatureLists : map<string, FeatureList> (example: used for time series)
